<h2>How this works</h2>

<p>Our aim is to re-enforce our users’ ‘higher selves’ using technology and a simple but powerful psychological principle; loss aversion.</p>
<p>The concept is fairly straightforward. Users’ geographical locations – as determined by their phones’ GPS – are used as a proxy for engagement in certain activities. After setting time related targets pertaining to these locations, users put ‘skin in the game’, whereby they sign up to losing money if they don’t hit their targets. If they hit their targets, they have their money returned to them. If not, they lose their money but pick a charity to which it all gets donated. This might sound a little strange, but an example should serve to explain. 
    
<p>Albert wants to get in shape but is having trouble motivating himself to go to the gym. He often starts fitness programs but after a few weeks his motivation slips, and he finds himself on the couch when he promised he’d be lifting weights. This keeps happening and is a source of considerable frustration – so Albert downloads BetYouWill. After registering, he uses google maps to set the gym as his target location. Then he specifies that he wants to be at the gym for four separate one-hour sessions next week. He could have specified a total four hours over the course of any number of sessions, or specified target times to arrive at the gym, but four one-hour sessions suited him nicely. 
    
    Crucially, Albert then puts ‘skin in the game’. Using the sliding scale in the app allowing stakes of between £1 and £1000, Albert stakes £50 of his money that he will make his target of four sessions next week. This feels a little strange to him, but he’s willing to give it a go. Low and behold, the next week Albert makes all four sessions. His money is transferred safely back to him, but he reuses it to reset his target the following week, and again makes all four sessions. He keeps resetting his target week after week, and in this way becomes a weekly gym goer. One week, down the line, something unexpected happens, and Albert misses his four-session target that week. Albert is annoyed that his stake money is gone. But he is now presented with a range of charities to which he can choose the money is donated. Albert picks a charity he is passionate about, and sets a new stake of £50 to ensure he is at the gym the next week. </p>
    
<p>In the above scenario, Albert is converted into a gym-goer through harnessing a well-documented psychological principle known as loss Aversion. Loss aversion dictates that desire to avoid loss is a more powerful personal motivator than desire for gain. Loss aversion was the subject of the 2002 Nobel prize in Economics, and is very observable, with some studies suggesting loss to be twice as powerful a motivator as equivalent gain. With a suitable way to measure performance (such as location tracking), as well as strict enforcement, users can harness loss aversion to augment personal motivation and enhance thier ability to achieve their goals.</p>
